# Chval

Simple Linux compatible program which when ran displays the chmod value of a file or a folder,
I felt this was a common problem I kept finding on Linux, so I decided to make this. :D

# Install - (for debian users)

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install gcc -y
    git clone -b master https://github.com/RiskyGUY22/chval.git && cd chval
    ./script.sh
    echo "Done Installing!"

Any problems or suggestions please let me know!
